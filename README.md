# Attribution Manager

This plugin provides developers with tools to store video game credits and manage
attributions for individual assets. It aims at making it easy to give correct attribution
to assets imported from third parties and keeping the attribution up to date.

Credits can be collected manually and automatically. They're stored in a single
resource that can be hooked up easily to any kind of credits scene.

Attributions for imported resources are entered in the inspector. There are pre-made
attribution types for the most common CC-style licenses found on the various asset
stores around the internet.
